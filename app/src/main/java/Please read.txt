Dear Hristo,

I wish you the best of success and luck!
Do try your best, but when you feel you can't anymore, it's good to take a break :)

Even if sometimes you feel like, "ahh, this is too much, too complex, how can we ever do this", don't worry,
 we're awesome people and God will help us find a way! (say it however you want ;P)

 The most important thing is to feel that you are doing your best, since no one can ask more than that!

Thanks for everything until now, and FIGHT ON!~~ (echo: oonnn):D ^_^
